    "## Answer:\n",
    "In Python, an **exception** is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to handle runtime errors and unexpected situations that can arise in a program. They provide a way to catch and handle errors in a program in a structured and organized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax errors,** on the other hand, are errors in the syntax of the code that prevent the code from being executed. They occur when the code is written in a way that does not conform to the rules of the Python language. Syntax errors are usually caught by the Python interpreter when the code is being parsed, before it is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors** is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the execution of a program, when the code is being parsed by the interpreter. Exceptions can be handled and recovered from, while syntax errors need to be fixed before the code can be executed."

    "**When an exception is not handled,** the program will terminate and an error message will be displayed to the user. The error message will contain the type of exception that was raised, along with a stack trace that shows the sequence of function calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack trace provides information about where in the code the exception was raised and can help in identifying the cause of the problem. However, if the exception is not handled, the program will not be able to continue executing and the user will not be able to recover from the error.\n",
