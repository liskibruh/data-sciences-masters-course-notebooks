    "## Answer:\n",
    "**Database:** A database is a software application that allows you to store, organize, and retrieve data. It is a structured collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated in various ways. Databases are essential for managing and processing large volumes of data in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Databases:** SQL databases are relational databases, which means that they use a tabular structure with rows and columns to store data. SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning that the structure of the data is defined beforehand, and the data must conform to that structure. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL Databases:** NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use the traditional table-based schema. NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning that data can be added to the database without defining the structure beforehand. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, graph, or column-family. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis."

    "## Answer:\n",
    "**Primary Key:** A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key constraint ensures that the primary key value for each row in a table is unique and cannot be null. By using primary keys, you can establish relationships between tables and ensure data consistency across the database. For example, a table of students might have a primary key of \"student_id\", where each student has a unique identifier, and this key is used to link data in other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key:** A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. A foreign key constraint is used to ensure that the data in the foreign key column is consistent with the data in the primary key column of the related table. By using foreign keys, you can establish relationships between tables, which is a fundamental aspect of a relational database. For example, a table of courses might have a foreign key \"instructor_id\" that refers to the primary key \"instructor_id\" in a table of instructors. This foreign key constraint ensures that the instructor ID value in the \"courses\" table corresponds to an existing instructor in the \"instructors\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. Primary and foreign keys are essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity in a relational database."
