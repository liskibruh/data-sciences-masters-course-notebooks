    "# Question No. 1:\n",
    "What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "**Ordinal Encoding** is a technique where the categories of a categorical variable are assigned an ordered numerical value based on their rank or position. \n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, if we have a variable \"education level\" with categories \"High School\", \"College\", and \"Graduate School\", we can assign them values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This technique assumes an inherent order or hierarchy in the categories and is useful when the categories have a clear ordering, such as in the case of education level, where \"Graduate School\" is higher than \"College\", which in turn is higher than \"High School\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding**, on the other hand, is a technique where each category of a categorical variable is assigned a unique numerical value. \n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, if we have a variable \"color\" with categories \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\", we can assign them values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This technique does not assume any order or hierarchy in the categories and is useful when the categories do not have an inherent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An example where we might choose one over the other** is when encoding the categorical variable \"size\" with categories \"Small\", \"Medium\", and \"Large\". If we believe that the size categories have a clear ordering, such as \"Small\" being smaller than \"Medium\" and \"Medium\" being smaller than \"Large\", we might choose to use Ordinal Encoding. On the other hand, if we believe that the size categories do not have an inherent order, such as \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\" in the \"color\" example, we might choose to use Label Encoding."

    "Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "The steps for Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "2. Order the categories based on the mean of the target variable, with the category having the highest mean assigned the highest ordinal value.\n",
    "3. Assign an ordinal value to each category based on its rank in the ordered list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, let's say we have a categorical variable \"city\" with categories \"New York\", \"San Francisco\", and \"Seattle\", and we want to predict a target variable \"income\". We can perform Target Guided Ordinal Encoding as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean income for each city: \"New York\" has a mean income of 75,000 dollars \"San Francisco\" has a mean income of 100,000 dollars and \"Seattle\" has a mean income of 85,000 dollars.\n",
    "2. Order the cities based on the mean income: \"San Francisco\" has the highest mean income, followed by \"Seattle\", and then \"New York\".\n",
    "3. Assign an ordinal value to each city based on its rank in the ordered list: \"San Francisco\" is assigned the ordinal value of 3, \"Seattle\" is assigned the ordinal value of 2, and \"New York\" is assigned the ordinal value of 1."

    "# Question No. 3:\n",
    "Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "**Covariance** is a measure of the extent to which two random variables are linearly related. Specifically, it measures the degree to which the values of one variable change in relation to the values of another variable. If two variables have a positive covariance, it means that when one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. If they have a negative covariance, it means that when one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. If the covariance is zero, it means that the variables are not linearly related.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance is important in statistical analysis** because it is a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. This relationship can provide important insights into the underlying nature of the data and can inform decisions about modeling and prediction. For example, in finance, covariance is used to measure the degree to which the returns on two different stocks are related, which can help investors diversify their portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance is calculated** as the sum of the product of the deviations of each variable from its mean, divided by the sample size minus one. The formula for the covariance between two variables X and Y with sample size n is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">cov(X,Y) = 1/(n-1) * âˆ‘(X_i - X_mean) * (Y_i - Y_mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X_i and Y_i are the values of the variables at the ith observation, X_mean and Y_mean are the means of the variables, and the summation is taken over all n observations."
