    "What are the different data structures used in Tensorflow? Give some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "- **Tensors:** Tensors are the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow, representing multi-dimensional arrays of data. They can be scalar (0-dimensional), vector (1-dimensional), matrices (2-dimensional), or higher-dimensional arrays. Tensors are used for storing and processing the input data, intermediate computations, and output predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables:** Variables are mutable tensors that can be updated during training. They are often used to store the learnable parameters of a machine learning model, such as weights and biases. TensorFlow provides the tf.Variable class for creating and manipulating variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparse Tensors:** Sparse tensors are a specialized form of tensors used to efficiently represent and process sparse data, where most of the values are zero. They store only the non-zero elements along with their indices. TensorFlow provides the tf.sparse.SparseTensor class for working with sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ragged Tensors:** Ragged tensors are used to handle sequences or arrays with varying lengths. Unlike regular tensors where all dimensions have fixed sizes, ragged tensors allow for dynamic lengths along one or more dimensions. TensorFlow provides the tf.RaggedTensor class for working with ragged data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Datasets:** TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) is a library that provides pre-processed datasets for machine learning tasks. It provides an abstraction for handling large-scale data efficiently by representing it as a sequence of elements. The tf.data.Dataset class is used to create, transform, and manipulate datasets in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queues:** Queues are used for asynchronous data loading and processing, especially when dealing with large datasets that do not fit entirely in memory. TensorFlow provides various queue implementations, such as tf.queue.FIFOQueue and tf.queue.PaddingFIFOQueue, to facilitate efficient data pipeline management."
