    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are mathematical concepts that are used in linear algebra. In simple terms, an eigenvector is a vector that remains in the same direction after a linear transformation, while an eigenvalue is a scalar that scales the eigenvector during this transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition is a method used to factorize a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It is an important technique in linear algebra and is used in a variety of applications, such as image processing, quantum mechanics, and finance.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">A = [[2, 1],<br>\n",

    "λ^2 - 4λ + 3 = 0<br>\n",
    "λ1 = 1<br>\n",
    "λ2 = 3\n",

    "A square matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has a set of linearly independent eigenvectors. The condition for diagonalizability can be stated as follows: a square matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the size of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's assume that A is diagonalizable, which means that it can be written as A = PDP^(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A, and P is a matrix containing the eigenvectors of A. Since A is diagonalizable, it follows that:\n",

    "The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that connects the Eigen-Decomposition approach to the diagonalizability of a matrix. The theorem states that a symmetric matrix is always diagonalizable, which means that it can be factorized into a set of eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues.

In particular, it allows us to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix, which can be used for various applications such as data analysis, image processing, and quantum mechanics.\n",
